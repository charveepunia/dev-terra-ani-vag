A go Application which displays the hostname of the server on which it is running . 

Step1. Go to the Actions above (gitLab workflow: CI):
       - build Docker 
       - Test Docker using Dgoss
       - Docker images pushed to repo        

Step2. Use the Vagrant file given in the repo, run below commands:
       - vagrant up 
                - it install Ansible 
                              - Ansible install Docker, Kubectl, minikube (ansible-playbook playbook.yaml)
                              - terraform command to deploy the app on minikube 
                                     - terraform init 
                                     - terraform plan
                                     - terraform apply 
         
                              
                - installs Terraform ( was facing issue installing terrafrom from ansible, so did it with vagrant)
